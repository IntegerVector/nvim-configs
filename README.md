# Nvim Configs

That's my personal neovim configuration

To install Packer and configs run:
```sh
./install.sh
```

To remove everything run:
```sh
./remove.sh
```

"./update.sh" script does pulls new version, instead it's just puts configs in nvim folder same as "./install.sh" but without installing Packer.
Use it when you did some small changes to configuration and you just need to put it to nvim folder quickly
